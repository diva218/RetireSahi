> **Your retirement, simplified.** A premium NPS planning app built for every Indian professional who will, someday, retire.

---

## Overview

Most Indians treat retirement planning like a math problem — staring at abstract numbers like "₹5 Crores" with no idea if that's enough or how to get there. NPS Pulse is built to fix that.

We bridge what behavioral economists call the **Future-Self Gap** — the disconnect between who you are today and who you'll be at 60. Instead of asking you to think in crores, NPS Pulse asks you a simpler question: *what does your retirement actually look like?* Do you want to travel internationally twice a year? Live in a comfortable home with premium healthcare? Never worry about medical bills? You pick the life. We calculate the number.

Built specifically for Indian NPS (National Pension System) subscribers — government employees, private sector workers, and self-employed individuals alike — NPS Pulse combines a Retirement Readiness Score, tax optimization tools, and an AI-powered pension co-pilot into one clean, modern app. It's not a calculator. It's a decision support system for the most important financial journey of your life.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.x ([Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- Dart 3.x (bundled with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free tier is sufficient)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nps_pulse.git
   cd nps_pulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

   > Never commit your `.env` file. It is already in `.gitignore`.

4. **Set up Supabase database**

   Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

   ```sql
   -- Profiles table
   create table profiles (
     id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade primary key,
     first_name text,
     last_name text,
     age integer,
     gender text,
     sector text,
     employer_name text,
     monthly_salary numeric,
     target_retirement_age integer,
     tax_regime text default '',
     created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
   );

   -- NPS Data table
   create table nps_data (
     id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
     user_id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade,
     current_corpus numeric default 0,
     monthly_employee_contribution numeric default 0,
     monthly_employer_contribution numeric default 0,
     fund_choice text default 'auto',
     equity_allocation numeric,
     last_updated timestamp with time zone default now()
   );

   -- Lifestyle goals table
   create table lifestyle_goals (
     id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
     user_id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade,
     tier_name text,
     monthly_amount numeric,
     line_items jsonb,
     created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   alter table profiles enable row level security;
   alter table nps_data enable row level security;
   alter table lifestyle_goals enable row level security;

   -- RLS Policies
   create policy "Users can manage own profile"
     on profiles for all using (auth.uid() = id);

   create policy "Users can manage own nps data"
     on nps_data for all using (auth.uid() = user_id);

   create policy "Users can manage own lifestyle goals"
     on lifestyle_goals for all using (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

5. **Generate code (Freezed + Riverpod)**
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

6. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # On Chrome (development)
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000

   # On connected Android device
   flutter run

   # On Android emulator
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   flutter run
   ```

## How the Readiness Score Works

The Readiness Score is a single 0–100 number that tells you how well-funded your retirement is projected to be. Here's how it's calculated in plain English:

1. **Project your future corpus** — We take your current NPS corpus and grow it at an assumed annual return (8.5%–10% depending on your sector and age). We then add the future value of your ongoing monthly contributions compounded over your remaining working years.

2. **Calculate what you actually need** — We take your chosen retirement lifestyle (e.g. Comfortable = ₹1,20,000/month today) and inflate it to what it will cost at your retirement age using a 6% annual inflation rate. We then multiply by 25 years of retirement life to get your required corpus.

3. **Divide and score** — We divide your projected corpus by your required corpus to get a ratio, then map it to a 0–100 score:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 86–100 | Excellent 🟢 | You're on track or ahead of target |
| 71–85 | Good 🟢 | Minor adjustments will get you there |
| 51–70 | On Track 🔵 | You're heading in the right direction |
| 31–50 | At Risk 🟠 | Significant gap — action needed soon |
| 0–30 | Critical 🔴 | Major gap — start optimizing now |

The score updates live as you adjust your contributions using the Power Slider on the dashboard.
